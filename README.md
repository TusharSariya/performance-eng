# Performance Engineering

Hands-on projects for learning systems performance, eBPF, and observability — inspired by Brendan Gregg's work.

**Note:** The majority of the code in this repository is AI-generated and is intended for learning purposes only.

## What's here

- **[plans/](plans/)** — Roadmap of 20 projects (CPU, memory, I/O, network, eBPF) with learning path and references. **Start here:** [plans/README.md](plans/README.md).
- **Implemented projects** — Each has its own directory (e.g. `02-cache-line-false-sharing/`) with code, README, and scripts.
- **[pointer-cheat-sheet.md](pointer-cheat-sheet.md)** — Quick C pointer reference.
